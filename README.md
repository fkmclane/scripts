assorted scripts of varying functionality


address.py
----------

address.py blinks the current primary IP address on an attached [Blinkstick](https://www.blinkstick.com/). I made this one to figure out what the IP address of my Raspberry Pi is without plugging in a monitor and keyboard.


cipher.py
---------

cipher.py encodes or decodes plain text using a padded cipher based on morse code.


snow.py
-------

snow.py shows snow in your console with adjustable amount, wind, and types of snowflakes.
