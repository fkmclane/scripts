# Scripts

assorted scripts of varying functionality


## Python


### address.py

address.py blinks the current primary IP address on an attached [Blinkstick](https://www.blinkstick.com/). I made this one to figure out what the IP address of my Raspberry Pi is without plugging in a monitor and keyboard.


### cipher.py

cipher.py encodes or decodes plain text using a padded cipher based on morse code.


### snow.py

snow.py shows snow in your console with adjustable amount, wind, and types of snowflakes.


### ftctimer.py

ftctimer.py shows a simple console timer with sounds for the [FIRST Tech Challenge](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc).


## VBScript


### Ubuntu.vbs

Ubuntu.vbs starts [Bash for Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux) then has [urxvt](http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/rxvt-unicode.html) run [fish](http://fishshell.com/) and connect to [Xming](http://www.straightrunning.com/XmingNotes/) giving a more usable terminal.
